                <p>Weimaraners were bred in Germany to hunt big game. Today, they're still always ready to head out for an adventure. These dogs weigh between 55–90 pounds, with male Weimaraners usually bigger. The female dogs will average about 24 inches in height, while the boys will be a tad taller (25–27 inches).</p>
