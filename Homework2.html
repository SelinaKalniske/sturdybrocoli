                <p>Weimaraners were bred in Germany to hunt big game. Today, they're still always ready to head out for an adventure. These dogs weigh between 55–90 pounds, with male Weimaraners usually bigger. The female dogs will average about 24 inches in height, while the boys will be a tad taller (25–27 inches).</p>

                <p>They enjoy exercise, and plenty of it, along with lots of quality time with their humans. Instantly recognized by a distinctive silvery-gray coat.</p>
                <p>A properly bred Weimaraner will be solid colored, with maybe a small white spot on the chest. The face, with its amber or blue-gray eyes framed by long velvety ears, is amiable and intelligent.</p>
                <p>Weimaraners are excellent with kids and yearn to be full-fledged family members. Easy grooming, trainability, a loving nature, and a can-do-attitude make them excellent pets, as long as owners are committed to keeping them physically active and mentally engaged.</p>
